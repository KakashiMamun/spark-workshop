# Exercise: Basic Streaming Aggregation (groupBy)

Develop a standalone Spark Structured Streaming application (using IntelliJ IDEA) that runs a streaming query that counts the words (in a batch) and prints the result out to the console.

The query can use any streaming data source (e.g. `csv`) and `console` for the streaming sink.

Use `sbt package` and `spark-submit` to run the application.
